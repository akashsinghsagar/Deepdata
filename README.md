# üìä Deepdata Analysis Project

This repository contains an **end-to-end data analysis project** that explores, analyzes, and visualizes a dataset using both **Python (EDA)** and **Power BI (Dashboard)**.

## üöÄ Project Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in Python (`EDA_Deepdata.ipynb`)

   * Data cleaning & preprocessing
   * Descriptive statistics
   * Visual exploration (distributions, correlations, trends)
   * Outlier & missing value detection
   * Key insights generation

2. **Interactive Dashboard** in Power BI (`DeepData_powerbi.pbix`)

   * KPIs & summary metrics
   * Categorical and numerical distributions
   * Time-series and trend analysis
   * Correlation & comparison visuals
   * Drill-through & filters for interactivity

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

### For Python (EDA)

* Python 3.8+
* Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
* Libraries:

  * pandas
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn
  * (others used in your notebook, e.g., scikit-learn, plotly)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### For Power BI

* Power BI Desktop (latest version)
* Power BI Service (optional, for sharing dashboards)

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### 1. Run EDA Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook EDA_Deepdata.ipynb
```

* Follow the steps in the notebook to clean and analyze the dataset.
* Export the processed dataset to `clean_data.csv`.

### 2. Open Power BI Dashboard

* Open `Deepdata_Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
* Refresh the data to load the updated `clean_data.csv`.
* Explore the interactive visuals.

## üìä Results & Insights

* Clear data summary with missing value analysis
* Visual distribution of key variables
* Correlation heatmaps highlighting feature relationships
* Outlier detection & handling
* Power BI dashboard with KPIs, filters, and drill-through analysis

*(You can insert screenshots of your Power BI dashboard and key plots here!)*

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements

* Automate EDA pipeline with Python scripts
* Integrate Power BI dashboard with a live database (instead of CSV)
* Add machine learning models for predictive insights
